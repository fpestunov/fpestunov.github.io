      Summertime and the living is easy
      Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
      Oh your daddy's rich and your ma is good looking
      So hush little baby, don't you cry
      One of these mornings
      You are going to rise up singing
      Then you'll spread your wings
      And you'll take to the sky
      But till that morning
      There's a nothing can harm you
      With daddy and mammy standing by
      So don't you cry.
